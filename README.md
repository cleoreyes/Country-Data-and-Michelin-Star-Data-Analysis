  This project is to analyze the relationships between Michelin starred restaurants and every country in the world. The goal was to provide information to people who want to visit Michelin restaurants but don't know where to go. It is also for people who want to visit as many restaurants as possible. Readers can learn which countries contain the highest number of stars as well as the average cost to eat at those restaurants in relation to the development of that country. We hope readers can understand the relationship between the development of a country and how many fine dining restaurants it has to help plan out their future travels if they hope to visit these Michelin restaurants. Readers can use this data to help narrow down their choices depending on their comfort levels of travel.
